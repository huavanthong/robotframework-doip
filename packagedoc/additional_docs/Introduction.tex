% Introduction

\pkg\ is a Robot Framework library specifically designed for interacting with Electronic Control Units (ECUs) using the Diagnostics over Internet Protocol (DoIP).

At its core, DoIP serves as a communication bridge between external diagnostic tools and a vehicle's ECUs. This library, RobotFrameworkDoIP, 
provides a set of keywords that enable users to perform diagnostic operations and engage with ECUs, facilitating automated testing processes and interaction with vehicles through the DoIP protocol.

The \pkg\ sources can be found in repository \repo:
